      "The figure illustrates a sample document image from the PRUEBA OCR (Optical Character Recognition) dataset, specifically focusing on the OCR of a document with a red border. The document contains text in Spanish, and the figure is labeled as \"Sample #6 - Prueba OCR.\"\n\nThe text on the document is as follows:\n\n- Line 1: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 500\"\n- Line 2: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 501\"\n- Line 3: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 502\"\n- Line 4: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 503\"\n- Line 5: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 504\"\n- Line 6: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 505\"\n\nAdditionally, there is a highlighted section in red, which includes the following text:\n\n- \"Figura 500\"\n- \"Figura 501\"\n- \"Figura 502\"\n- \"Figura 503\"\n- \"Figura 504\"\n- \"Figura 505\"\n\nThis highlighted section seems to be emphasizing specific figures within the document, possibly indicating their importance or relevance in the context of the paper. The overall layout and structure of the document suggest it is a formal or academic text, and the OCR results are being presented for analysis or further processing.",
