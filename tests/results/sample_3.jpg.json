      "The image displays a slide with a red border and a white background, containing text in Spanish. The text is organized in a list format with numbers 1 through 6, each followed by a statement about a document. The statements are as follows:\n\n1. \"Linea 1 del documento de prueba. Valor: 200\"\n2. \"Linea 2 del documento de prueba. Valor: 201\"\n3. \"Linea 3 del documento de prueba. Valor: 202\"\n4. \"Linea 4 del documento de prueba. Valor: 203\"\n5. \"Linea 5 del documento de prueba. Valor: 204\"\n6. \"Linea 6 del documento de prueba. Valor: 205\"\n\nAt the top of the slide, there is a title in bold that reads \"Sample #3 - Prueba OCR.\" The text is aligned to the left and the font appears to be a standard sans-serif type. The slide seems to be part of a presentation, possibly related to optical character recognition (OCR) testing, as indicated by the text. The numbers and statements suggest a sequence or steps in a process, possibly related to the testing of a document's OCR capabilities.",
