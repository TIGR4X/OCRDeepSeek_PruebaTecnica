      "The figure illustrates a sample document from the PRUEBA OCR (Optical Character Recognition) dataset, specifically focusing on the OCR of a document with 6 lines. The document contains text in Spanish, and the figure highlights the OCR results for each line.\n\nHere is a detailed description of the figure:\n\n1. **Title and Context**:\n   - The title of the figure is \"Sample #5 - Prueba OCR\".\n   - The figure is part of a paper titled \"A Survey on the Use of Machine Learning in Document Analysis\".\n\n2. **OCR Results**:\n   - The figure shows the OCR results for each line of the document.\n   - Each line is labeled with a number from 400 to 405, indicating the OCR output for that particular line.\n\n3. **OCR Output**:\n   - **Line 1**: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 400\"\n     - This line is correctly recognized and highlighted in red.\n   - **Line 2**: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 401\"\n     - This line is also correctly recognized and highlighted in red.\n   - **Line 3**: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 402\"\n     - This line is correctly recognized and highlighted in red.\n   - **Line 4**: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 403\"\n     - This line is correctly recognized and highlighted in red.\n   - **Line 5**: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 404\"\n     - This line is correctly recognized and highlighted in red.\n   - **Line 6**: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 405\"\n     - This line is correctly recognized and highlighted in red.\n\n4. **Highlighted Lines**:\n   - The lines that have been correctly recognized are highlighted in red, making them easily distinguishable from the rest of the text.\n\n5. **OCR Performance**:\n   - The OCR system performs well, correctly identifying and highlighting the lines with numbers 400 to 405.\n   - The highlighted lines indicate that the OCR system is effective in recognizing the text within the document.\n\nThis figure effectively demonstrates the performance of the OCR system in recognizing and highlighting the lines of a document accurately.",
