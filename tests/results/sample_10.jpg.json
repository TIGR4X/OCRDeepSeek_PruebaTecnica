      "The figure illustrates a sample document image from the PRUEBA OCR (Optical Character Recognition) dataset, specifically focusing on the OCR of a document with handwritten text. The image is labeled as \"Sample #10 - Prueba OCR\" and shows a section of a document with handwritten text.\n\nKey elements in the figure include:\n\n1. **Handwritten Text**: The handwritten text is visible in the image and is part of the document being processed by the OCR system. The text appears to be in Spanish, as indicated by the language identifier \"Figura 900\".\n\n2. **OCR Output**: The OCR system has identified and extracted the text from the document. The extracted text is highlighted with a red box, and the corresponding OCR output is shown next to it. The OCR output includes the following lines:\n   - Line 1: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 900\"\n   - Line 2: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 901\"\n   - Line 3: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 902\"\n   - Line 4: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 903\"\n   - Line 5: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 904\"\n   - Line 6: \"del documento de prueba. Valor: 905\"\n\n3. **OCR System Performance**: The figure demonstrates the performance of the OCR system in recognizing and extracting handwritten text from a document. The highlighted lines show the extracted text, which appears to be a sequence of numbers followed by the word \"Valor\", indicating the recognition of the document's title or identifier.\n\n4. **Language Identifier**: The language of the document is identified as Spanish, as indicated by the language identifier \"Figura 900\".\n\nOverall, the figure provides a visual representation of how the OCR system processes and extracts handwritten text from a document, showcasing its ability to recognize and extract specific information from the text.",
