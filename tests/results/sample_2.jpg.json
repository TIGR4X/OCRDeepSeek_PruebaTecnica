      "The figure illustrates a sample document image from the PRUEBA OCR (Optical Character Recognition) dataset, specifically focusing on the OCR of a document with a red border. The document contains text in Spanish, and the figure is divided into two parts: the left side shows the original document image, and the right side shows the OCR results.\n\n### Detailed Description:\n\n1. **Original Document Image (Left Side):**\n   - The document appears to be a form or a questionnaire with multiple lines of text.\n   - The text is in Spanish, and it includes various fields such as \"Linea 1 del documento de prueba,\" \"Linea 2 del documento de prueba,\" and so on, up to \"Linea 6 del documento de prueba.\"\n   - Each line of text is labeled with a number from 100 to 105, indicating different sections or questions within the document.\n\n2. **OCR Results (Right Side):**\n   - The right side of the figure shows the OCR output, where the text has been converted into machine-readable format.\n   - The OCR results are enclosed within a red border, highlighting the areas where the OCR algorithm has identified and processed the text.\n   - The numbers 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, and 105 correspond to the same sections as in the original document image, indicating that the OCR has successfully identified and extracted these sections.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n- **OCR Accuracy:**\n  - The OCR results seem to be accurate, as the text within the red-bordered areas matches the content of the original document image.\n  - The numbers 100 to 105 are consistent with the layout of the document, suggesting that the OCR algorithm has effectively processed the text and identified the corresponding sections.\n\n- **Document Structure:**\n  - The document appears to be structured with clear headings and numbered questions, which is typical for forms or questionnaires.\n  - The presence of multiple lines of text indicates that the document might be longer and more complex, requiring a structured approach for processing.\n\n- **Application Context:**\n  - This figure is likely used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the OCR system in accurately extracting and recognizing text from documents.\n  - It serves as a validation step for the OCR system, ensuring that it can handle complex documents with multiple sections and questions.\n\nIn summary, the figure effectively demonstrates the OCR capabilities of the system by showing the original document image and the corresponding OCR results, highlighting the accuracy and structure of the extracted text.",
